    summary: |
      I am a data analyst and developer with over 10 years of experience designing and implementing scalable, optimized data solutions, primarily in the insurance industry. My expertise spans database management, data architecture, and process optimization, with a proven track record of enhancing system efficiency and performance.
      
      I recently completed a master’s degree in Statistics and Operations Research, specializing in machine learning and process optimization. For my capstone project, I developed classification models and information retrieval systems using Transformers and LLMs, gaining hands-on experience in advanced data analysis and machine learning techniques.
      
      I’m now eager to apply my deep expertise in data development, combined with my newly acquired machine learning skills, to support organizations in building adaptive, high-performing data systems. I thrive in collaborative, multidisciplinary environments and look forward to contributing to impactful data engineering projects that drive operational success and innovation.
